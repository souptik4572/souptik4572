### Hi there 👋, I am Souptik

I am a passionate and dedicated software engineer with a strong background in computer science and engineering.

Throughout my professional journey, I have gained valuable experience working on diverse projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I thrive in fast-paced environments and my goal is to create innovative and efficient solutions that drive meaningful impact.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in languages such as C/C++, Python 3, JavaScript (ES6), Java, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and SCSS. I am well-versed in frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, GraphQL, Flask, Django, Prisma ORM, SQLAlchemy ORM, and Mongoose ORM. Moreover, I have hands-on experience with tools/platforms like Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, Bash, Docker, AWS (EC2, S3, DynamoDB), and Linux. I am proficient in working with databases like MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
